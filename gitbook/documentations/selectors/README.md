# Selectors

The `Selectors` module standardizes the instruction selection process, enabling the extraction of high-quality instruction datasets from raw, unprocessed instruction data. The raw data can be sourced from publicly available instruction datasets or generated by the framework itself. You can choose the appropriate selector based on your specific needs.
